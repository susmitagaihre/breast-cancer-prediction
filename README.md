Breast Cancer Prediction is an innovative project that utilizes binary image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to predict whether a given breast cancer ultrasound image is malignant or benign. The dataset used in the project is the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset, which is available on Kaggle.

The project begins by training a CNN model using the ultrasound images. The trained model is then saved and loaded into a web application built using the Django framework. The web application takes an image as input and returns the predicted result as output.

In addition to the breast cancer prediction functionality, the web application also provides valuable information about breast cancer, including its symptoms and prevention measures. This information can be extremely beneficial to those seeking to learn more about breast cancer and how to reduce their risk of developing it.

The technology used in this project includes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification, Python as the primary programming language, and the Django web framework for building the web application. Overall, the Breast Cancer Prediction project is a prime example of how technology can be leveraged to provide valuable insights and support to those affected by breast cancer.
