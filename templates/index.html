        <h5 class="card-title"><b>About Breast Cancer </b></h5>
        <p class="card-text">Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the breast. It occurs when
            the cells in the breast begin to grow abnormally and form a mass or lump. These cells can spread to other
            parts of the body, which is known as metastasis.

            Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and the second most common cancer overall. It
            can occur in both men and women, but it is much more common in women. The risk of developing breast cancer
            increases as a person ages and is also influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors.

            Treatment for breast cancer often involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and
            hormonal therapy. Early detection is key to the successful treatment of breast cancer, so it is important
            for individuals to be aware of the signs and symptoms and to undergo regular screening.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Benign breast cancer, also known as non-cancerous or non-malignant breast
                        cancer, is a
                        type of breast condition
                        in which abnormal cells are present in the breast, but they do not invade surrounding tissue or
                        spread
                        to other
                        parts of the body.

                        Common types of benign breast conditions include fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas, and cysts.
                        These
                        conditions
                        can cause lumps or masses in the breast, but they do not pose a threat to life and do not
                        require
                        treatment
                        unless they are causing pain or discomfort.

                        It is important to have any breast changes evaluated by a doctor to determine whether they are
                        benign or
                        require
                        further testing or treatment. Regular screening, such as mammograms, can also help detect benign
                        or
                        malignant
                        changes in the breast early on, when they are most treatable.

                        In contrast to benign breast conditions, malignant breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that
                        is
                        characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of cancer cells and can be life-threatening
                        if left
                        untreated.</p>

                        uncontrolled growth and spread of cancer cells. In this type of cancer, the cells in the breast
                        begin to grow abnormally and can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the
                        body, such as the lymph nodes, bones, liver, and lungs.

                        Malignant breast cancer can develop in any part of the breast, including the ducts (the tubes
                        that carry milk from the lobules to the nipple), the lobules (the glands that produce milk), or
                        the tissue in between.

                        The exact causes of malignant breast cancer are not known, but several risk factors have been
                        identified, including age, gender, family history of breast cancer, certain gene mutations (such
                        as BRCA1 and BRCA2), and certain lifestyle factors (such as alcohol consumption and lack of
                        physical activity).

                        Diagnosis of malignant breast cancer typically involves a combination of physical exams, imaging
                        tests (such as mammograms), and biopsies. Treatment often involves a combination of surgery,
                        radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy, and the choice of treatment depends on
                        various factors such as the stage and type of the cancer, the patient's age and overall health,
                        and personal preferences. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for improving the
                        prognosis of patients with malignant breast cancer.</p>

            The most common symptoms of breast cancer are:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change in size or shape of the breast
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dimpling or puckering of the skin
                </li>
                <li>
                    A rash or redness on the skin or around the nipple
                </li>
                <li>
                    A change in the appearance of the nipple, such as inversion
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discharge from the nipple (other than breast milk)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Persistent pain in the breast or armpit
                </li>

            </ol>
            It is important to note that many of these symptoms can also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, but it
            is
            always
            best to have any changes checked by a doctor.

                <h1>Preventions</h1>
            </div>
            There are several ways to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer, including:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Maintaining a healthy weight:</b> Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Regular exercise:</b> Physical activity has been linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Limiting alcohol consumption:</b> Drinking alcohol is associated with an increased risk of breast
                    cancer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Breastfeeding:</b> Women who breastfeed for a longer period of time have a reduced risk of breast
                    cancer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Hormonal birth control:</b> Women who use hormonal birth control have a slightly reduced risk of
                    breast
                    cancer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Avoid exposure to estrogen:</b> Estrogen therapy after menopause and exposure to estrogen-like
                    compounds
                    in the environment can increase the risk of breast cancer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Regular screening:</b> Regular screening such as mammograms can help detect breast cancer early
                    when
                    it
                    is more
                    treatable.
                </li>
            </ol>
            It is important to remember that no single factor causes breast cancer and these steps can only reduce the
            risk,
            not
            guarantee prevention. Talk to your doctor to determine the best prevention strategies for you.
